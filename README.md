## FAQ
Q. What does it do? \
A. Collect listening reports for a single user (multiple planned) over a specific timeframe and create CSVs containing artist, album, and track information. The main draw here is time-adjusted scrobble counts (krobbles), though not explicitly implemented.

Q. Does it work? \
A. Yes, but only for me or someone with a music library structure quite like mine. The matching code is idiosyncratic and I haven't yet implemented the naive processing mode yet. This was supposed to be implemented in lastfm-stats-v2, which may or may not be published at some point.

Q. What can I do with this data? \
A. You can use it to construct images, grids, collages, and any other sort of data visualization you like! Consider checking out [griddler-url] for ideas.
